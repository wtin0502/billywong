             a Hong Konger and an UX UI designer with unlimited enthusiasm. I am a current master graduate in
            Entrepreneurship and Innovation Management with distinction from Loughborough University London.  As an
            entrepreneurial, creative and curiosity-driven thinker, I combine eastern and western culture to develop
            universally palatable content and solutions.

            What makes me inspired most is to communicate with people from different backgrounds. This is because I
            believe that communication is the most effective way to understand everything around me. That's why I love
            talking to people, interacting with them and questioning about something that I am unfamiliar with.

            Even though I was not majoring in UX UI-related subjects, I have taken several UX UI courses online and have
            constantly delved into these fields during my spare time as I am loving it! I find that UX and UI are the
            subjects that link utility, connectivity and creativity together. They not only help businesses grow, but
            also more tightly connect different parties through a continued improvement and optimisation on products and
            services. At the same time, I wish I can utilise my creativity to bring new changes to UX and UI, thereby
            changing the world day-by-day.
